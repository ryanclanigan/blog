Anyone ever just sit there and drink water for a while? A cool sip of water? Maybe some ice? Just a cool sip? 2 sips? 3 sips? 4 sips? You sit there, and put it down. You think for a while, and then you pick it up again. The thing your water is in, and you take a long, cool sip.

Wow. Let it sink in. A cool sip. Maybe even a _cold_ sip. How is it cold? The ice. You put it back down. You go to take another sip. Its empty. You get up, go to the sink and let it flow. It does.

The sip, the next sip, is cool. Maybe refreshing? It's cool. You take another sip. Wow.

You're full now.
