I've been slowly watching the Friday the 13th movies with a partner. Hey man, these movies kind of suck. I _genuinely_ do not know how they ever fucking happened man. However, they are slowly getting better. 

Here's my review for Part 1:
It's bad. Don't watch it. It's like watching sandpaper on a table. You can imagine it has some value, but that value is dubious sitting on your table.

Here's my review for Part 2:
_Fine_ background watch. One or two creative kills and significantly better pacing. 2 months later I remember 1 kill, so that's something

Part 3!
It still doesn't have a story, but the atmosphere is way better! They really fuck with the timing of when Jason is around and when he's going to kill. When he does finally start killing, he perfectly rides the line that Halloween hits of feeling like a normal guy and a demon in human shape. The chase scene at the end kinda overstays its welcome, but at least everyone dies in stupid ways.
