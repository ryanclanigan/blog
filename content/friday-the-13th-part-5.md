Alright here are two quick reviews of Friday the 13th Part 4 (aka The Final Chapter) and Part 5 (aka A New Beginning)

Part 4:

Hey this one's pretty solid! I hate the loser dude who says nothing but "dead fuck" and makes fun of his friend who in fact is not a dead fuck. Also, I am so sorry Corey Feldman, but I really really dislike looking at you and hearing your voice. I've seen you in The Lost Boys, The Burbs, and now this, and you elicit a reaction that can only be described as contempt. Look at this face: ![Corey Feldman, courtesy of https://www.starstills.com/ss3348592-corey-feldman-movie-photo/]({static}/images/coreyfeldman.jpg) His jaw is strong enough to shatter concrete walls and his eyes have seen a thousand suns live and die.

The kills are pretty solid, there's some creative handling in how they deal with Jason as he smashes his way through multiple houses, and no one is profoundly stupid. It works well. It's probably my second favorite after Part 3, and honestly for 3 it's mostly the harpoon kill that gets me going. 


Part 5:

Bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad. This is only spared by how much I dislike the first one and how goofy the characters deaths are. A mother and son curse at each other and threaten to kill people before they are killed via a cleaver in a motorcycle powered decapitation and a not-motorcycle powered slash through a window. A couple goes to fuck in the woods, and then the guy stops to go poop in the woods (without toilet paper???), she gets killed in the most gratuitous boob scene in the series thus far, and then he gets his head crushed with a belt. A man goes to poop (different man, different poop), and his girlfriend comes to harass him as they poop. They then sing what would be the melody to a shitty pop song, and then she magically dies and he gets stabbed through the wall of the bathroom. After all that, a woman who has been barely in the film and cannot act her way out of a drug store cereal section becomes the main character, deigning us to suffer at her pitiful presence. The film ends with grown up not-Corey Feldman becoming a new Jason. God this sucks.
